### MCP Launch Errors

If you encounter errors when launching any MCP (including test echo MCP), follow these steps:

1. **Completely uninstall CodeMaestro**
   - Remove the CodeMaestro application from your system
   
2. **Delete the cache folder**
   After uninstalling, manually delete the CodeMaestro cache directory:
   - **macOS:** `~/.codemaestro`
   - **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\.codemaestro`
   - **Linux:** `~/.codemaestro`

3. **Reinstall CodeMaestro**
   - Download and install the latest version
   - Reconnect to your Unity project

This process clears all cached data and configurations, resolving most MCP-related launch issues.
